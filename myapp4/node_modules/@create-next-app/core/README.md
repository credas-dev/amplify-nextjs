```

create-next-app is available on yarn as well. It can be installed with the following command:

```

You don't need to install or setup Webpack or Babel. They come with Next.js, so you can just start coding after running create-next-app command line.

## Create a Next App in seconds

To create a new Next.js app called <i>my-app</i> with `default` or `material` or `bootstrap` or `semantic` templates.

1. Go to [Create Next App templates](https://create-next-app.js.org/#templates)
2. Choose a template to create your Next.js app (such as default)
3. And then run `create-next-app my-app --template default`
4. Well done!

It will create a directory called <i>my-app</i> inside the current folder.
Inside that directory, it will generate the initial project structure and install the transitive dependencies:

```
.
├── README.md
├── components
│   ├── head.js
│   └── nav.js
├── next.config.js
├── node_modules
│   ├── [...]
├── package.json
├── pages
│   └── index.js
├── static
│   └── favicon.ico
└── yarn.lock
```

No configuration or complicated folder structures, just the files you need to build your app. When the installation is done, you can open your project folder, run this command:

```
cd my-app
```

Inside the newly created project, you can run some built-in commands:

### `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`

Runs the app in development mode.<br/>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.<br>
You will see the build errors and lint warnings in the console.

Out of the box, we get:

  - Automatic transpilation and bundling (with webpack and babel)
  - Hot code reloading
  - Server rendering and indexing of `./pages`
  - Static file serving. `./static/` is mapped to `/static/`

### `npm run build` or `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `.next` folder.<br/>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

### `npm run start` or `yarn start`

Starts the application in production mode. The application should be compiled with `npm run build` first.

Now you maybe ready to code and deploy your app!

## Start Next Examples

There are a bunch of examples in the Next.js repository that you can use to bootstrap your app.

To bootstrap your app with example:

1. Go to [Create Next App examples](https://create-next-app.js.org/#examples)
2. Choose an example to bootstrap your app (such as basic-css)
3. And then run `create-next-app my-app --example basic-css`
4. Well done!

Now you maybe ready to code and deploy your app!
